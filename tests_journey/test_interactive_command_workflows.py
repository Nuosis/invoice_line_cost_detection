Journey Tests for Interactive Command Workflows

This test suite validates complete user journeys through the interactive
CLI commands, focusing on the full workflow from command invocation to
report generation.

These tests simulate the complete user experience of running interactive
commands and validate both the user interface and the resulting system state.

IMPORTANT: Tests specifically against 5790265786.pdf - the file from the original bug report!

✅ **MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT: HANGING ISSUES RESOLVED**
All tests now complete without requiring user input - the primary goal has been achieved!

TEST EXECUTION ORDER (Most Fundamental to Most Complex):

1. MOST FUNDAMENTAL (Basic validation and setup):
   - test_file_validation_5790265786_exists_and_accessible ✅ VERIFIED PASSING
     * Complexity: Very Low
     * Purpose: Validates that the target PDF file exists and is readable
     * Dependencies: None - just file system checks
     * Why fundamental: Basic prerequisite validation before any processing
     * User Interaction Mocking: ✅ NONE REQUIRED (pure file system validation)
     * Test Status: ✅ VERIFIED PASSING

2. FUNDAMENTAL (Core bug reproduction and attribute testing):
   - test_pathwithmetadata_bug_reproduction_5790265786 ⚠️ NEEDS INVESTIGATION
     * Complexity: Low-Medium
     * Purpose: Tests PathWithMetadata attribute handling (the original bug)
     * Dependencies: PathWithMetadata class, basic mocking
     * Why fundamental: Tests the core bug fix without full workflow complexity
     * User Interaction Mocking: ✅ COMPREHENSIVE (all prompts mocked correctly)
     * Test Status: ⚠️ MOCKING WORKS, BUT VALIDATION ENGINE REPORTS DATA QUALITY ISSUES
     * Issue: ValidationEngine reports "Critical errors in parts_lookup: 6 - 5 unknown parts"
     * Problem: The provided invoices should NOT have data quality issues - indicates valid system issue

   - test_original_bug_scenario_exact_reproduction ✅ VERIFIED PASSING
     * Complexity: Medium
     * Purpose: Reproduces the exact user scenario that caused the AttributeError
     * Dependencies: Full CLI context, extensive mocking, PDF processing
     * Why fundamental: Tests the specific bug scenario but with more integration
     * User Interaction Mocking: ✅ COMPREHENSIVE (all prompts mocked correctly)
     * Test Status: ✅ VERIFIED PASSING - PathWithMetadata bug is fixed
     * Key Achievement: Confirms that PathWithMetadata creation works without AttributeError

3. INTERMEDIATE (Single workflow validation):
   - test_complete_single_file_interactive_workflow_5790265786 ⚠️ NEEDS INVESTIGATION
     * Complexity: Medium-High
     * Purpose: Tests complete single-file processing workflow
     * Dependencies: Full CLI context, real PDF processing, real validation engine
     * Why intermediate: Full workflow but single file scope
     * User Interaction Mocking: ✅ COMPREHENSIVE (all prompts mocked correctly)
     * Test Status: ⚠️ MOCKING WORKS, BUT VALIDATION ENGINE REPORTS DATA QUALITY ISSUES
     * Issue: Same data quality issues as other tests - validation engine stops before report generation

   - test_threshold_validation_with_5790265786_would_have_caught_bug ⚠️ NEEDS INVESTIGATION
     * Complexity: Medium-High
     * Purpose: Tests threshold-based validation workflow (would have caught original bug)
     * Dependencies: Full CLI context, real validation engine, threshold prompts
     * Why intermediate: Full workflow with specific validation mode
     * User Interaction Mocking: ✅ COMPREHENSIVE (all prompts mocked correctly)
     * Test Status: ⚠️ MOCKING WORKS, BUT VALIDATION ENGINE REPORTS DATA QUALITY ISSUES

4. MOST COMPLEX (Batch processing and multi-file scenarios):
   - test_batch_processing_with_5790265786_in_directory ⚠️ NEEDS INVESTIGATION
     * Complexity: High
     * Purpose: Tests batch processing workflow with multiple files
     * Dependencies: Full CLI context, batch processing logic, multiple file handling
     * Why most complex: Handles multiple files, batch operations, and complex state management
     * User Interaction Mocking: ✅ COMPREHENSIVE (all prompts mocked correctly)
     * Test Status: ⚠️ MOCKING WORKS, BUT VALIDATION ENGINE REPORTS SYSTEMIC DATA QUALITY ISSUES
     * Issue: ValidationEngine reports unknown parts across ALL PDF files (5-43 unknown parts per file)

MOCKING PATTERN ESTABLISHED:
- ✅ Mock functions at `cli.commands.invoice_commands.*` instead of `cli.prompts.*`
- ✅ All user interaction mocking now works correctly
- ✅ No more hanging tests waiting for user input

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
- ✅ PathWithMetadata bug is FIXED and verified
- ⚠️ SYSTEMIC data quality issues discovered across all provided invoice PDFs
- ⚠️ ValidationEngine reports unknown parts when PDFs should be clean

RECOMMENDED EXECUTION: Run tests in the order listed above to ensure dependencies
are validated before more complex scenarios that build upon them.
