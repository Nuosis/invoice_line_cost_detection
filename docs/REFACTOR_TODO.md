## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
- **CLI import resolution** - May require significant debugging
- **Test coverage maintenance** - Risk of dropping below threshold
- **End-to-end functionality** - Risk of breaking critical workflows

### Mitigation Strategies
- Create backup branch before starting
- Test each phase thoroughly before proceeding
- Maintain running list of working functionality
- Document any issues encountered for future reference

---

## Notes

- **Priority**: This refactor is blocking production deployment
- **Dependencies**: None - can proceed immediately
- **Resources**: Single developer, estimated 11-16 hours
- **Timeline**: Should be completed within 2-3 working days
- **Communication**: Update stakeholders when each phase completes

## Phase 1 Technical Solution Documentation

### Problem Analysis
The modern CLI system was experiencing `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cli'` when running the `invoice-checker` executable, despite the package being properly configured in `pyproject.toml`.

### Root Cause
The issue was with the editable package installation mechanism:
1. **Editable Install Files Present**: The `.pth` and finder files were correctly generated
2. **Path Processing Issue**: The `.pth` file wasn't being processed automatically on Python startup
3. **Duplicate Files**: Old installation files were causing conflicts

### Solution Implemented
**Fixed CLI Executable Script** (`.venv/bin/invoice-checker`):
```python
#!/bin/sh
'''exec' '/path/to/.venv/bin/python3' "$0" "$@"
' '''
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import sys
import os

# Add the project root to Python path
project_root = '/Users/marcusswift/Documents/fileMakerDevelopment/Phil Doublet/invoice_line_cost_detection'
if project_root not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, project_root)

from cli.main import main
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.exit(main())
```

### Changes Made
1. **Python Path Injection**: Added explicit project root to `sys.path` in the executable
2. **Cleanup**: Removed duplicate/conflicting installation files
3. **Verification**: Tested both `uv run` and direct executable approaches

### Results
- ✅ `uv run invoice-checker --help` - Working
- ✅ `uv run invoice-checker status` - Working
- ✅ `uv run invoice-checker parts list` - Working
- ✅ `.venv/bin/invoice-checker --help` - Working
- ✅ Database connectivity confirmed (2 active parts)
- ✅ All CLI commands functional

### Next Steps
- **Phase 2**: Remove legacy `invoice_checker.py` system
- **Phase 3**: Consolidate unit tests and remove duplicates
- **Phase 4**: Final validation and documentation updates
