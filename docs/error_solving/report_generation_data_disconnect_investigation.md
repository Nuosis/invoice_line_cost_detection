# Report Generation Data Disconnect Investigation

## Symptom
Invoice processing extracts line items correctly (logs show 6 items with proper part numbers, descriptions, and rates) but the generated CSV report contains all 0 values and empty fields for Part Number, Description, etc. We know this because:
- Logs show: "[H2] Parsed line item 1: code=GP1212NAVY, desc=PANT FR CARGO DRIFIRE, rate=1.150"
- CSV shows: "5790265776,07/17/2025,,,,,1,$0.00,$0.00,$0.00,$0.00,$0.00,VALID,"
- 6 line items extracted successfully but report contains 6 rows of empty/zero data

## Steps to Recreate
1. Run 'uv run python -m cli.main invoice process docs/invoices/5790265776.pdf --output test_fix_report.csv --no-auto-open'
2. Check logs - shows successful extraction of 6 line items with proper data
3. Check generated CSV report - shows 6 rows but all with 0 values and empty fields
4. Logs show: '[H2] Parsed line item 1: code=GP1212NAVY, desc=PANT FR CARGO DRIFIRE, rate=1.150' but CSV shows: '5790265776,07/17/2025,,,,,1,$0.00,$0.00,$0.00,$0.00,$0.00,VALID,'

## Attempts to Solve the Problem
1. Fixed PDF text extraction - working correctly (1762 characters extracted)
2. Fixed line item parsing - working correctly (6 line items extracted with proper data)
3. Fixed multi-line cell parsing in _parse_table_row_to_line_item() method
4. Verified data structure population shows correct mapping
5. All logs show successful data extraction but report generation is not using this data

## Hypotheses

1. **Data Structure Mapping** (Most Fundamental)
   - hypothesis: Extracted LineItem objects are not properly mapped to validation data structures
   - null hypothesis: LineItem objects are correctly mapped to validation data structures with all fields populated

2. **Validation Engine Processing**
   - hypothesis: Validation engine is not receiving the extracted line item data correctly
   - null hypothesis: Validation engine receives and processes line item data correctly

3. **Report Data Source**
   - hypothesis: Report generator is using wrong data source or empty validation results
   - null hypothesis: Report generator uses correct validation results with populated line item data

4. **Data Flow Between Components**
   - hypothesis: Data is lost or corrupted between extraction and report generation
   - null hypothesis: Data flows correctly between all components without loss

5. **InvoiceProcessor Integration**
   - hypothesis: InvoiceProcessor is not properly passing extracted data to validation/reporting
   - null hypothesis: InvoiceProcessor correctly passes extracted data through the pipeline

6. **Report Generation Logic** (Most Dependent)
   - hypothesis: Report generation logic has bugs that prevent proper data display
   - null hypothesis: Report generation logic correctly formats and displays validation data
