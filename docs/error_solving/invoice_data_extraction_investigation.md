# Invoice Data Extraction Investigation

## Symptom
Invoice validation reports show $0.00 totals and empty data fields. When processing invoices, the generated CSV reports contain empty values for Part Numbers, Descriptions, and Rates columns, with all monetary calculations showing as $0.00.

## Steps to Recreate
1. Run the invoice processing command on test PDFs in docs/invoices/ directory
2. Examine the generated CSV validation report
3. Observe that Part Number, Description, and Rate columns are empty
4. Observe that all monetary values (Line Total, Expected Total, Variance) show as $0.00
5. The processing completes without visible errors but produces no meaningful data

## Attempts to Solve the Problem
Field mapping issues between validation and reporting components have been resolved to ensure consistent CSV field names. The system now handles missing data gracefully with appropriate defaults. However, the core symptom persists: validation reports contain no extracted invoice line item data and all calculations result in zero values.

## Hypotheses

1. **PDF Text Extraction** (Most Fundamental)
   - hypothesis: PDF text extraction is failing to extract any readable text from the invoice files
   - null hypothesis: PDF text extraction successfully extracts readable text from invoice files

2. **Line Item Parsing Logic**
   - hypothesis: Line item parsing logic fails to identify and extract structured data from extracted text
   - null hypothesis: Line item parsing logic correctly identifies and extracts structured data from text

3. **Data Structure Mapping**
   - hypothesis: Extracted data is not properly mapped to the expected data structure fields
   - null hypothesis: Extracted data is correctly mapped to expected data structure fields

4. **Validation Engine Input**
   - hypothesis: Validation engine receives empty or malformed data from the extraction process
   - null hypothesis: Validation engine receives properly formatted data with actual values

5. **Report Generation Data Flow**
   - hypothesis: Report generation process loses or corrupts data during CSV creation
   - null hypothesis: Report generation process preserves all data during CSV creation

6. **File Format Compatibility** (Most Dependent)
   - hypothesis: The specific PDF format of test invoices is incompatible with the extraction library
   - null hypothesis: Test invoice PDF format is compatible with the extraction library
