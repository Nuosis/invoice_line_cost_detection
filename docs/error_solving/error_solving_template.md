# Report Card Model Binding Investigation

## Symptom (note the absense of explaination - just the fact sman! do not include this comment in the actual file)
When clicking "View Report Card", the policy check fails . We know this because:
- No logs from Student::resolveRouteBinding
- No logs from ReportCardPolicy::view
- URL contains correct StudentID (392513)

## Hypotheses

1. **FMModel Base Class** (Most Fundamental)
   - hypothesis: FMModel base class overrides or interferes with standard binding
   - null hypothesis: FMModel preserves standard binding behavior

2. **Model Key Field**
   - hypothesis: StudentID field name mismatch between URL and FileMaker
   - null hypothesis: Field names match correctly

3. **Route Parameter Format**
   - hypothesis: Route parameter format `{student:StudentID}` is incorrect for FileMaker models
   - null hypothesis: Route parameter format is correct and compatible

4. **Middleware Order**
   - hypothesis: Policy middleware runs before model binding can complete
   - null hypothesis: Middleware order allows binding to complete first

5. **FileMaker Model Binding**
   - hypothesis: FileMaker models require different binding approach than standard Eloquent
   - null hypothesis: FileMaker models use standard binding process

6. **Route Cache** (Most Dependent)
   - hypothesis: Route caching prevents new binding configuration from taking effect
   - null hypothesis: Route caching is not affecting binding
